All source files for a simple, account managing, music library web application.

The web app allows users to create and manage accounts.  Once an account is 
created, the user can upload music files.  Files uploaded to the user's 
library can be listened to.  Music files can also be shared with other users,
and other users songs can be listened to, and added to the users library, where
they are kept.
